# Definitions

This is small document with an overview of all the definitions, words, etc. we use througout our code:

**Station**= a city or station in a city which has (at least) one train-connection connected to it

**Connection**= a direct (rail)road between two stations

**Route** (of traject/lijn) = combination of connections representing the route a train would ride

**Timetable** (of 'lijnvoering')= the collection of all the different routes

**Map**= the representation and collection of all stations and connections.

**Latitude**= Latitude lines run east-west and are parallel to each other but measure north-north. So if you go north, latitude values increase.

**Longitude** = Longitude lines run north-south and measure east-west.
