# Exploration vs. Exploitation

# Variables:
# the population size (=De start hoeveelheid HCs & max hoeveelheid states)
# the number of generations
# a fitness function
# the number of runners to create for each solution
# the distance for each runner


# Nr. of shoots = m

# All shoots send out runners p/itteration
# --> This provides a terminating criterion and is represented by g_max.

# Fitness-function [0,1] = hoe 'goed' een solution is & dus based op de doel-functie
# --> Map fitness function (f(x)) on the following N(x) = 1/2 (tanh (4f(x) − 2) + 1)

# Number of runners = n_r = [nmax N_ir]
# --> n_max is max number of runners to generate (=population size?)

# d_(r,j) = 2(1 − N_i)(r − 0.5)
# for j = 1, . . . , n, where n is the dimension of the search space.
